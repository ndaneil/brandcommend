Have you ever wanted to share your favourite brands, or look at the products your friends are using, but couldn't find the right place for it?

We created the perfect platform on the web where you can register a profile, save and share your favourite brands with all the people you are connected to, look at what others have been up to, and join exclusive groups full of like-minded enthusiasts.

### What do We offer to you as a user?

- The opportunity to share your favourite brands in the perfect place. No more awkward social media posts that feel like an advertisement.
- Become part of brand-centered exclusive fan clubs to connect with people sharing your brand-identity.
- As a bonus, your favorite brands may reward you, offer you deals and even community events for your enthusiastic support.

### The technologies we used to build Brandcommend:

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.0
- MySQL
- HTML/CSS

### Business plan:
- **Brandcommend is free for enthusiasts who want so share their favorite brands.**
- For early adopter brands, we charge a fee based on successful purchases initiated from offers received through our platform. 
- We offer a subscription-based community service allowing fans to communicate with brands directly. The fee depends on the size of the community.
- Brands might pay for advertisements that would be placed for people that don't already have their favourites set for the given category. Pay to be the first option on the list!
- The brands might purchase aggregated user data about their most loyal fans.

### Future plans:
- We would like to create mobile applications for both iOS and Android
- Exclusive deals with some companies
- We need fully fletched out backend (authentication, active database, protection of users)
- We can organize VIP events to the most loyal people in communities and invite brands to promote themselves

**Brandcommend is not just a platform; it's a community-driven ecosystem connecting brands and enthusiasts in a seamless and rewarding experience. Join us as we redefine brand engagement!**
